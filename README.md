1. Clone this repository
2. Update device_config.h with your buoy and sensors specifications
3. Update secrets.h with your WiFi details and Supabase API key (ask info@projectseasense.org)
4. Use Arduino IDE to build and upload the software on to the ESP32 in your buoy
5. Run the CALIBRATE serial command
6. Calibrate the sensors and update device_config.h with the calibration values
8. Go sailing and let your buoy log data
9. Come back and run the UPLOAD command to push the logged data to the server
10. See your contribution on the Live Map! https://projectseasense.org/livemap
